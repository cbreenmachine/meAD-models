# TODO
- []  Rename other to `LOAD-methylome-processing`
- [] This will be repo for figures for paper: volcano plot, waffle plot, etc.
- [] SNP calling and what not will stay in biostat project (this should be anything that operates on BCF, BAM files)
- [] DMPs-app should really do minimal processing (already the case)

This repo contains analysis for any/all papers. This includes model fitting with DSS, DMR calling, figures, etc.

Anything that requires operating on BCF, BAM files (things considered more bioinformatics-y) are found in LOAD-methylome-processing. These repos are complimentary, but 

# This Repo
- Code runs on personal computer
- A recent installation of R is sufficient for running (most) code
- Mostly downstream analysis, figure generationg, etc.

# LOAD-methylome-processing
- Code mostly meant for cluster
- Mix of bash, python, R, and command-line tools
- Operating on fastq, bcf, and bam files
